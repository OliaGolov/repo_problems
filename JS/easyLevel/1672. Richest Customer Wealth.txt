#1672

You are given an m x n integer grid accounts where accounts[i][j] is the amount of money the i​​​​​​​​​​​th​​​​ customer has in the j​​​​​​​​​​​th​​​​ bank. Return the wealth that the richest customer has.

A customer's wealth is the amount of money they have in all their bank accounts. The richest customer is the customer that has the maximum wealth.

SOLUTION:

accounts = [[1,5],[7,3],[3,5]]

function getWealth(accounts) {
    let sumInSubarr = 0;
    let wealth = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < accounts.length; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < accounts[i].length; j++) {
            sumInSubarr += accounts[i][j]
        }
        wealth.push(sumInSubarr)
        sumInSubarr = 0;
    }
    let max = wealth[0];
    for (i = 0; i < wealth.length; i++) {
        if (wealth[i] > max) {
            max = wealth [i]
        }
    }
    return max;
}

console.log(getWealth(accounts))

MAIN DIFFICULTY AND NOTES:
Looping through arrays of array
Aslo possible to use js method math.max()
